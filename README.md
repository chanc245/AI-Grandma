Granny Bytes is a web-based AI application that uses Google’s Gemini API to create a helpful and constructive Grandmother-inspired kitchen chatbot, engaging new technologies with traditional cooking.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration stems from the personal relationships we all have with our grandmothers, and about the ways we can harness AI to emulate this inter-generational connection. 

Within the relationship between grandmothers and the youth, food is a big factor of unification, and so we decided to use cooking as the focus for mirroring this relationship– seeing how AI and cooking can be a facet of our humanity. 

As for the user experience, we were inspired by cozy 8-bit style games and retro computer interfaces: all of our assets having a pixelated characteristic and having the elements propped on a reimagination of the old Windows UI. 

## What it does
Our app simulates the experience of cooking with grandmothers, utilizing the AI capabilities of Gemini to imitate the grandmother's presence.

As of now, users are presented with 4 pre-written cultural recipes that have been passed down by each team members’ grandmothers. 

When clicking on a recipe, users will be greeted with an interactive recipe guide with a section hosting the ingredients, the chat room where the grandmother will list the steps one at a time and have users type in any questions they have to which the grandmother will respond before proceeding to the next step, and a section where users can upload their final product for feedback by the AI powered grandmother.

## How we built it
We first used Figma to create the general visualization, interactions, and assets of our app. 

Procreate was also used to create certain assets like the animated grandma gif and the visuals for each step of each recipe. 

We then used HTML and CSS to translate the visuals to the front end. JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js, were used to build the web application's backend.

Further all the team members were able to collaborate on the code via Github functionalities. 
Lastly, we used Render to deploy our app.
